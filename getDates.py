"""
script for fetching foodsaving dates/locations from foodsharing.de and creating events for the users Google Calendar.

these files have to be in the same Folder:
- getDates.py       main script file downloads the foodsharing events and passes this to
- makeDate.py       script for the Google Stuff.
- config.py         with your own credentials, renamed from config_template.py
- client_secret.json downloaded via the Google API Manager

Setup:
    stuff to install/import:
    - pip
        apt-get install python3-pip

    - module bs4
        BeautifulSoup to store data pulled from html:
        apt-get install python3-bs4
        
    - modules apiclient, oauth2client, httplib2
        Google API modules to access calendar:
        pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client
        
    before running anything for the first time follow the instructions at
    https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python
    to activate the Google Calendar API and download client_secret.json.
    
    Then try to run makeDate.py to initiate the verification procedure 
    for the Google Calendar, as for the first time you won't have
    ~/.credentials/calendar-python-makeDate.json
        
    It will (try to) open a web page where you login with your google 
    account to confirm the access rights of this scipt to your calendar.
    If you did this it should send you to an temporary webserver at 
    localhost:8080 set up by the script, but this didn't work for me.
    
    So if you do this on a remote box or have the same problem like me, 
    use the parameter
     --noauth_local_webserver
    you will then have to paste a verification code. easy-peasy.  

    If makeDate.py is done it will print your next 10 entries of your main
    calendar and you will know this script can talk with your calendar.

    Then don't forget to rename config_template.py to config.py and enter 
    your foodsharing.de login and (if you want) password as well as other
    config stuff.

    If i haven't forgotten anything, you should be ready for the
    
Usage:
    sudo getDates.py
    
    Enter your password if necessary. Output says wether any new events 
    have been created or not.
    
    
This script here logs in to the dashboard of foodsharing.de using your 
credentials set below. Then it saves the dashboard-page locally, and 
parses it, searching for the list containing the dates 
and shops ("n√§chste Abholtermine").
This data is the used to create events with makeDate.py

Todo:
    * I don't know. it works. you could always add some funny stuff...
